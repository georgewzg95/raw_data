1. Expend Verilog designs(ONGOING by Anthony)
  - Opencores: a way to generate submodules for opencore large designs (ONGOING: 2/17: Arithmetic, Communication controller)
  
2. generating training data from all designs in the datasets: feature extraction with yosys and golden value from vivado(SOLVED)
  - yosys scripts (SOLVED)
    - list features extracted from yosys
    - save the each version of extracted features
   
  - tcl scripts for vivado (SOLVED)
    - metric list extracted from vivado (power, utilization)
    - save the each version of extracted metrics
    - subprocess to load/balance the vivado process
    
  - problem:
  1. how to launch the process automatically and capture the error message(SOLVED)
     - subprocess python
     - manually launch the batch
     - slurm ( not applicable to LRC )
  
  2. attention_layer failed to implement on xc7z020clg484-3 (overutilization of I/O ports: 1074 v.s. 330) and xc7v585tffg1761-3 (overutilization of I/O ports: 1074 v.s. 850)(SOLVED)
     - keep going to see the fraction of designs encountering the same problems
  
3. creating models with the exsiting data
  - LASSO(SOLVED)
  
4. Curating the datasets (e.g., tags) (NO TIME FOR THIS)

5. seperate static and dynmaic power, remove static (LOW PRIORITY)
  - I do not think this will help a lot on the model, if dynamic power is well fit in linear model, static power should not hurt the performance of prediction

6. Predict the DSP/LUT power individually, do a testing (see 12)

7. include the toggle rate as a feature(LOW PRIORITY)
   - currently not necessary

8. coefficients do not make sense for the features (SOLVED)
   - the bugs in yosys collection scripts, see 10
   - possibly the model is not fit

9. check the design with large prediction error(SOLVED)
   - need to set clock properly when running the power estimation

10. fix the bug that yosys collection scripts are not able to collect data correctly(SOLVED)
   - not including the bit width of cells

11. modified the run_cmds.py script to generate the clock automatically for every run_tcl.tcl(PARTIALLY SOLVED)
   - the scripts partilly work, but the some comment clock can mislead the script to generate wrong clock signal, we can remove all comments from the design file though

12. Use hand-crafting designs according to the feature lists and to see how it is related to the power consumption(URGENT COMING)

13. any baseline for this? I can only see XPE as the most relevant power estimation.
