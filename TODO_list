1. Expend Verilog designs
  - Opencores: a way to generate submodules for opencore large designs (ONGOING: 2/17: Arithmetic, Communication controller)
  
2. generating training data from all designs in the datasets: feature extraction with yosys and golden value from vivado
  - yosys scripts (DONE)
    - list features extracted from yosys
    - save the each version of extracted features
   
  - tcl scripts for vivado (ONGOING)
    - metric list extracted from vivado (power, utilization)
    - save the each version of extracted metrics
    - subprocess to load/balance the vivado process
    
  - problem:
  1. how to launch the process automatically and capture the error message:
     - subprocess python
     - manually launch the batch
     - slurm ( not applicable to LRC )
  
  2. attention_layer failed to implement on xc7z020clg484-3 (overutilization of I/O ports: 1074 v.s. 330) and xc7v585tffg1761-3 (overutilization of I/O ports: 1074 v.s. 850)
     - keep going to see the fraction of designs encountering the same problems
  
3. creating models with the exsiting data
  - LASSO
  
4. Curating the datasets (e.g., tags)

Dec 21
5. seperate static and dynmaic power, remove static. 
6. Predict the DSP/LUT power individually, do a testing
7. include the toggle rate as a feature
8. coefficients do not make sense for the features
9. check the design with large prediction error
