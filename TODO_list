1. Expend Verilog designs
  - Opencores: a way to generate submodules for opencore large designs
2. generating training data from all designs in the datasets: feature extraction with yosys and golden value from vivado
  - yosys scripts (done)
  - tcl scripts for vivado (in progress)
3. creating models with the exsiting data
  - LASSO
4. Curating the datasets (e.g., tags)
