1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: /home/zhigang/DATA/raw_designs/vtr_designs/arithmetic/open_cores/verilog/processed_files/output/rc4.v
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `/home/zhigang/DATA/raw_designs/vtr_designs/arithmetic/open_cores/verilog/processed_files/output/rc4.v' to AST representation.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\rc4'.
