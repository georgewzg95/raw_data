1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/mcml_submodules/mult_signed_32.v
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `/home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/mcml_submodules/mult_signed_32.v' to AST representation.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\mult_signed_32'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/mcml_submodules/mult_signed_32.v:67.1-94.4 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.
