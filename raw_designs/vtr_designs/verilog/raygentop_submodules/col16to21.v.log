-- Executing script file `out.ys' --

1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/raygentop_submodules/col16to21.v

Generating RTLIL representation for module `\col16to21'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/raygentop_submodules/col16to21.v:16.5-36.8 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.

     1/1: $1\col16[15:0]

3.7. Executing PROC_DLATCH pass (convert process syncs to latches).
