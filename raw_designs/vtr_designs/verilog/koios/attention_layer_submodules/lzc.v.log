-- Executing script file `out.ys' --

1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend: /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/lzc.v
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `/home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/lzc.v' to AST representation.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\lzc'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/zhigang/raw_data/raw_designs/vtr_designs/verilog/koios/attention_layer_submodules/lzc.v:42.1-50.4 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.
Successfully finished Verilog frontend.
